# Weekly-Retails-Sales
In this project, my partner (Luz Solorzano-Ortiz) and I looked into multiple data frames on retail sales across 45 stores, for the year of 2010. We looked at how variable like holidays, store size, national CPI and fuel price, affected the weekly sales. We found a correlation between increase in sales during the weeks leading up to a holiday, such as thanksgiving/black friday and christmas, where sales peaked during the weeks of the holidays. We also found a correlation between the stores size and the weekly sales, where larger stores had higher sales, compared to smaller. We found no correlation between CPI and fuel price and weekly sales.
